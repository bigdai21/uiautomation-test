# Web App Automation 

## Overview
This folder contains scripts which perform automation testing on a web application. For automation, a locally hosted web application has been used for automation. The web application is attached as part of the repository and it can be accessed [here](https://git.toptal.com/screening/md-samsul-kabir/tree/master/uiautomation/TestApplication)

## Technology
For scripting, following technology and framework has been used:
* JAVA  (_Scripting language_)
* Cucumber  (_Test written in BDD Style_)
* Maven  (_Build automation tool for JAVA_)
